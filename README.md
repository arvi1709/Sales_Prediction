Sales Prediction System
Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a machine learning system to predict sales for a retail dataset. The task is to forecast future sales using historical data and various regression algorithms, including Linear Regression and LSTM models. The solution provides insights that can be used to optimize business strategies, such as marketing campaigns, inventory planning, and promotions.

1. Problem Statement
The aim is to build a sales prediction system to forecast future sales for items sold at various outlets. This involves handling complex data with missing values, categorical variables, and additional features like seasonality, promotions, and economic indicators.

2. Dataset Description
The datasets include:

train.csv: The training dataset with historical sales data.
test.csv: The testing dataset for which predictions are made.
Key Features:
Item_Identifier: Unique ID for items.
Item_Weight: Weight of items.
Item_Fat_Content: Nutritional information (low fat, regular).
Item_Type: Type of product.
Outlet_Identifier: Unique ID for outlets.
Item_Outlet_Sales: Sales value for each product (target variable in training data).
Additional features like Seasonality, Promotions, and Economic Indicators have been added to enhance the model.

3. Preprocessing
The preprocessing steps include:

Filling missing values for Item_Weight and Outlet_Size.
Encoding categorical variables (e.g., Item_Fat_Content, Item_Type) using one-hot encoding.
Adding dummy columns for Seasonality, Promotions, and Economic Indicators to simulate the impact of external factors.
4. Modeling
Two models were implemented for predicting sales:

Linear Regression: A baseline regression model for comparison.
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory): A more advanced model to capture sequential dependencies in the data.
Both models were trained and evaluated using cross-validation techniques.

5. Evaluation
The models were evaluated using the following metrics:

RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error): Measures the standard deviation of the residuals.
MAE (Mean Absolute Error): Measures the average magnitude of errors.
R-squared: Measures how well the model fits the data.
Linear Regression Performance:
RMSE: <your_value>
MAE: <your_value>
R-squared: <your_value>
LSTM Performance:
RMSE: <your_value>
MAE: <your_value>
R-squared: <your_value>
6. Hyperparameter Tuning
Grid Search was applied to the Linear Regression model to find the best set of hyperparameters. The best parameters obtained were:

fit_intercept: <True/False>
normalize: <True/False>
7. Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sales-prediction.git
cd sales-prediction
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Ensure you have a dataset saved in the appropriate location (e.g., train.csv and test.csv).

8. Usage
Run the Python script to train the models and generate sales predictions:

bash
Copy code
python sales_prediction.py
The script will preprocess the data, train the models, and save the predicted sales in sample_submission.csv.

9. Results
The results of the sales prediction, including performance metrics and model evaluation, are saved in sample_submission.csv. Use the insights provided by the models to inform business strategies.
